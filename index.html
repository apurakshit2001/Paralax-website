            Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a different
            speed than the foreground content while scrolling.

            What is parallax on a website?

            Parallax scrolling is used to add visual interest to a website and engage users as they scroll through a web
            page. In a parallax scrolling effect, both the foreground and background are moving, but the background
            typically moves much more slowly, giving the illusion of depth.

            Parallax scrolling can really enhance the overall user experience of a website, livening up a design with motion and enhancing its interactivity. When people see that scrolling doesn't move everything in one fixed block, but rather touches multiple elements, they feel more in control over how they experience a website.
